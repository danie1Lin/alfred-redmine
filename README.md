An Alfred workflow for accessing a Redmine server

Installation
------------

Download the workflow package and double click it -- Alfred will take care of the rest.

Usage
-----

Access the workflow using the keyword “rm”. The first time the keyword is used, only a single item will be available: “login”. Actioning this item will prompt you for your username and password. These are used to authenticate with your Redmine server to retrieve your API token; they aren’t stored afterwords.

Once you’ve logged in, a number of options will be available.
